"""Pure domain model for AI Agentic MCPscan (ticket T-102).

These types are the shared vocabulary of the whole tool. They are **frozen** and
use enums so invariants hold by construction, and they contain **no I/O** — the
entire module is unit-testable without a filesystem or network.

Security note (architecture refinement R1): there is intentionally **no field
that holds a raw secret value**. A detected secret is represented only by a
:class:`SecretFingerprint`, so no downstream renderer can leak it.
