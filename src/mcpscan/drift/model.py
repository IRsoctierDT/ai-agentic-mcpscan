"""Pure model for configuration-drift detection (VISION Tier 5).

A :class:`Snapshot` is a normalized, comparable view of the machine's posture at
one point in time — a flat set of :class:`PostureFact`s, each with a **stable
key** (so the same server/finding/asset lines up across snapshots) and a
comparable ``detail``. :func:`diff_snapshots` turns two snapshots into a
:class:`DriftReport` of what appeared, disappeared, or changed.

Like ``domain``, this module is frozen and contains no I/O. Snapshots are built
from a scan ``Report`` (and optionally an ``Inventory``) in ``snapshot.py``.
