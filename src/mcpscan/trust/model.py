"""Pure model for agent trust analysis (VISION Tier 4).

Where ``scan`` grades *hygiene* and ``inventory`` names *what exists*, trust
analysis answers *what an agent's tools are trusted to do and access* — and,
crucially, which **combinations** of those powers make a tool a lateral-movement
risk. Each MCP server is a trust subject with a **Trust Score** (0–100, higher =
more trustworthy) and a set of :class:`RiskRelationship`s.

Frozen, enum-driven, no I/O. Trust profiles are built from parsed configs in
``analyze.py``; a profile never carries a raw secret (only a count).
