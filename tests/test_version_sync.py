"""Guard: the exported version resolves to pyproject.toml (T-407 release safety).

``mcpscan.__version__`` is derived from the installed package metadata
(``importlib.metadata``), which hatchling populates from ``[project].version`` in
pyproject.toml — so pyproject is the single source of truth. This test confirms
that wiring actually resolves (rather than falling back to the sentinel) and
matches the declared version, catching a broken/stale install or a packaging
misconfig before a release ships a wheel whose ``mcpscan --version`` lies. The
release workflow separately guards the git *tag* against the same field.
