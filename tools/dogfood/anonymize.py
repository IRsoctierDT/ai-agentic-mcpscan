"""Anonymize a real MCP config into a safe regression fixture (T-402, Phase 2).

The dogfood protocol turns every real false-positive / false-negative into a
permanent corpus fixture (proposal §4.3). Real configs can't enter the repo as
they are: they carry live secrets, usernames, and host paths. This scrubs a
collected config into a structurally-identical fixture that trips the **same
checks** — so the regression stays real — while carrying **nothing sensitive**.

Two guarantees, both by construction:

- **No raw secret survives.** Every value the scanner's own detector
  (``checks.secrets._looks_secret``) flags is replaced with a synthetic
  placeholder of the *same class* (a provider-shaped token still matches its
  provider regex; an entropy-flagged value becomes a same-length high-entropy
  fake), so the anonymized config still produces the identical finding — but the
  original bytes are gone.
- **No identity survives.** Home paths (``/home/<user>``, ``/Users/<user>``,
  ``C:\\Users\\<user>``) collapse to a generic user, and the report of what was
  changed carries only counts and categories, never a before value.

Usage:
    python tools/dogfood/anonymize.py real_config.json --host claude \
        --scope project --relpath .mcp.json

Prints the scrubbed config and a ready-to-paste ``Fixture(...)`` whose
``expects`` set is derived by actually running the scanner over the scrubbed
content — so the fixture's label is what the tool really produces, verified.
